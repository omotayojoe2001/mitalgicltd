# üîß VERCEL BUILD FIX

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED

The build error was caused by incorrect import path in `index.html`.

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed import path**: Changed `/src/main.tsx` to `./src/main.tsx`
2. **Updated Vite config**: Added proper build configuration
3. **Build optimization**: Added rollup options for better builds

## üöÄ REDEPLOY STEPS:

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve Vite build import path error"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Vercel Auto-Redeploy
- Vercel will automatically detect the changes
- New build will start immediately
- Should complete successfully now

### 3. Manual Redeploy (if needed)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

## üîç WHAT WAS WRONG:

### Original Error:
```
Rollup failed to resolve import "/src/main.tsx" from "/vercel/path0/index.html"
```

### Root Cause:
- Absolute path `/src/main.tsx` doesn't work in production builds
- Vite expects relative path `./src/main.tsx` for proper resolution
- Build process couldn't find the entry point

### Solution:
- Changed to relative path: `./src/main.tsx`
- Added proper build configuration in `vite.config.ts`
- Optimized rollup options for production

## ‚úÖ BUILD SHOULD NOW WORK:

The deployment will now:
1. ‚úÖ Clone repository successfully
2. ‚úÖ Install dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Build project with `npm run build`
4. ‚úÖ Deploy to Vercel CDN
5. ‚úÖ Serve website globally

## üéØ NEXT STEPS:

After successful deployment:
1. **Test the website** - Visit your Vercel URL
2. **Add custom domain** - Configure `mitalgic.com`
3. **Set up analytics** - Add Google Analytics
4. **Submit to search engines** - Google Search Console

The fix is minimal but critical for Vercel deployment success!
